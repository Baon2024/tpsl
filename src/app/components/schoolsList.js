Please note that we cannot consider a bursary application if you have not visited us prior to applying. The following questions are typically considered by the Head Master, Bursar and Governors when deciding on the level of award Does your family have the ability to improve its financial position? For example, if there are two partners, we would expect both to be working in paid employment unless one is prevented from doing so through illness, or because one partner needs to care for very young children or for other dependants. Could you use funds that you already have? If you have significant savings or investments, or have a lot of equity in your house, we would expect you to use this before we could give help with fees. Do you have other sources of household income? We may need to take this into account. Are you paying fees to other schools or universities? If so, our level of support will need to take this into account.  ",
