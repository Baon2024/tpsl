Our bursary programmes are intended to be transformational, we award to lower-income families who qualify for full or nearly full support. Our bursary programmes open up the world of Habs Girls to students whose families could not otherwise send their children here. Approximately 160 Senior School students attend Habs each year with bursary support and they will continue to receive support throughout their time at Habs, for as long as they need it. All students applying for a bursary will need to sit our standard entrance assessments.","We have an additional bursary scheme for students of Black African or Caribbean heritage that sits alongside the overall Habs bursary programme. Bright Futures is a new, donor-supported initiative, it aims to gain greater representation in higher education for individuals with protected characteristics (Equality Act 2010), who are also underrepresented at Habs and whose families could not afford to send them to Habs without substantial financial support. Funding is currently available for up to two fully funded spaces for 11+, 13+ or 16+ entry at Habs Girls.","The level of financial support we can offer is based on your financial declaration. The process includes an informal meeting with a member of our Finance team. As a guide, families whose total household gross income is below Â£50,000 is likely to qualify for a free school place. Households with total gross income of approximately Â£115,000 or more are not eligible for bursary support. Every year, each bursary is subject to a means-test reassessment."],

Many parents, grandparents and even godparents like to contribute as part of the scheme. The amount deposited with Habs is then used to pay your childâs fees as they fall due each term, until the pre-payment is exhausted. In return for holding the lump sum, the school will apply a discount to the advance payment of 3.50%, which approximates to a return on investment of 4.16% per year for higher-rate taxpayers. The scheme does not fix your future school fees. Yet the rate of return will be guaranteed at the time the money is received by Habs â and for however long it is held.","f you subscribe to the School Fees Refund scheme, you can claim back for absences due to illness or accident.

Scholarship awards may be made either for evidence of a high level of attainment and promise or exceptional specialist aptitude. Candidates are assessed through test, examination or observation, interview and reference.`,`Uppingham is proud of its moral and charitable commitment to widening participation in the School. To do so, we use as much of our funding as we can to enable as many young people as possible to benefit from an Uppingham education. For that reason, non means-tested scholarships would not ordinarily exceed 5% of the fees. Larger scholarship awards are made on the basis of financial need, which means that any scholarship award can be supplemented up to 110% of the school fees through a means-tested award.`,`At Uppingham a candidate may only hold one scholarship award at any one time so that they can specialise in their area of talent. This does not preclude them from participating in other areas of school life, however, the rich additional provision of each of our scholarship programmes requires pupils to manage their time judiciously within their field of expertise. Uppingham awards scholarships to candidates who show excellence in the following fields: Academic, Music, Art, Textiles, Design and Technology, Sport, Drama and All Rounder (The Thring Award, 13+ only). `],
